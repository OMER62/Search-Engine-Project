# Search-Engine-Project
As a part of the Information retrieval course task, we built a search engine based on Wikipedia corpus until 2021. The project execution in python and the workspace of google collab and the google cloud platform. To execute the project, we used the following methods and tools: word2vec-for analyzing the frequency of words in the documents variety,  Pyspark API for data pre-processing- based on the implementation of the Map-Reduce algorithm, Word Embedding-to find words with similar representation and in local search methods like TF-IDF.
Feel free to look at the collab notebook that include small part from the project and to be impressed by my work styling at the following link:
